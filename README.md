# Cellular-Component-Ontology-Prediction
Solution to the Cellular Component Ontology Prediction challenge.

In this project we want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a classification problem in bioinformatics. The focus is on proteins, which are essential biomolecules in living organisms that have various functions such as chemical reactions and structural support. The challenge is to classify 6,111 protein sequences and their corresponding graph structures into 18 different classes based on their location and function using the Cellular Component ontology. The approach is two-fold, using both graph analysis and natural language processing techniques to understand the protein sequences and structures. 
 
The performance of our models will be assessed using the logarithmic loss measure. This metric is defined as the negative log-likelihood of the true class labels given a probabilistic classifierâ€™s predictions.
